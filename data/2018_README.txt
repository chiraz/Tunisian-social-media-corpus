## Overview

This data was collected by students for a sentiment analysis project in my intro to text mining course, 2018-2019 acedemic year.
Each group was asked to collect social media comments about a Tunisian celebrity of their choice. 
The names of the files indicate the name of the celebrity.


## Remarks about text formatting issues

- The files are quite heterogeneous in how they are formatted, unfortunately! But most are well-structured csv files 
with the first line containing self-explanatory column names, and with one line per comment.

- In some files comments might span multiple lines and are surrounded with quotes, e.g. Samia Abbou_Comments.txt, Orange_comments.csv

- Some files might not be read correctly due to special arabic encoding:  Manal Amara files, ShemsFM_comments.csv, Salah_Mejri

- Some files are not read correctly because they contain Arabic text written left-2-right rather than the reverse: Aicha Atia files

- The "" in the Ouled Moufida_positive_twitter file may be problematic ...
